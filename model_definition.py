# Placeholder for custom model definition
# If you have the original model class, uncomment and modify below:

# import torch
# import torch.nn as nn
# 
# class CustomDETR(nn.Module):
#     def __init__(self, num_classes=2):
#         super().__init__()
#         # Your model architecture here
#         pass
#     
#     def forward(self, x):
#         # Your forward pass here
#         pass

# For now, this file serves as a placeholder.
# Users should provide their model class definition here if needed.
